## Overview

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/api/)

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. Upon visiting the app, the default weather of the default location, which is set to London, is loaded on screen. Users can click on the "search for places" button on the top left of the screen to search for the weather of their preffered location. On PC, the users, by clicking on the round button beside the "search for places" button, can, by their choice, get the weather of their current location or that of a location near it.
The default measuring scale is in Celcius. If the user has a prefference for using the Farenheit temperature scale, he/she can click on the button "F" button on the top right of the screen and the measurements will be made to display in Farenheit. The same goes for Celcius.
